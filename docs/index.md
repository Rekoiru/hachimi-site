# Documentation

Welcome to the Hachimi Edge documentation page!  
Check out all topics on the left sidebar. On mobile, you can find them in the menu at the top left.

## Installing Hachimi

Check out the [Getting Started](hachimi/getting-started) page.

## Using Plugins

Hachimi Edge supports a [plugin system](plugins/about) that allows extending its functionality.

## Contributing

Please read through the relevant docs and check out the various git repos. You can open an Issue there or send a PR directly, although discussing things with the team first is recommended in most cases.
If you need more help or want to contact us directly, join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hachimimod) and mention the `Developer` role in `#feedback`.

### As a Hachimi Edge developer

Development happens on the [Hachimi Edge repo](https://github.com/kairusds/Hachimi-Edge), with most active discussions on Discord.

### As a Hachimi Project translator

This relates to translating the Hachimi Edge UI, site & docs, community announcements, and providing user support. All for non-English languages.  
Contribute to [the site repo](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-site) or join the Discord to ask about providing translation for the community there.

### As a Game translator

The Hachimi Project does not handle game translation itself.  
If you'd like to help with this, check out the [Translation Guide](translation-guide/welcome) and contact [one of the game translation projects](/credits).
It can still be useful to hang around the Discord to stay up to date or ask tech questions. Contact one of the `Server Managers` to get a role.

#### Creating your own translation source

No project for your language or don't agree with the available ones? Start your own!  
Once you're familiar with the [Translation Guide](translation-guide/welcome), learn how to [configure a repo](translation-guide/repo-config) and submit your project [to Hachimi Edge's index](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-meta).
You can look at one of the [existing projects](/credits) for reference.  
**Note**: We do recommend to stick to one project per language if possible to avoid fragmentation and double work. If not, please make sure you follow any existing project's terms, don't blindly fork.

### As a community aide

The Hachimi Edge Discord needs people to help others with tech issues, provide testing of bugs and features for the developers, etc.
Join the Discord and apply in `#applications-info`.
